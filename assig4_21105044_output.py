3rd program
Enter first integer value(dividend): 8
Enter second integer value(divisor): 4

Quotient: 2 
Remainder: 0

a.
True, which means it is callable

b.
All values in result(i.e. quotient and remainder) are not non-zero(i.e. one of them is 0).

c.
Values greater than 4(in list format) are: [5, 6]

d.
The output of previous part in set datatype would be: {5, 6}

e.
The immutable set would be: frozenset({5, 6})

f.
The maximum value from the set is: 6
The hash value of 6(considering it to be integer) is 6 and its hash value is -1110542655300733783(if we consider 6 as a string).
